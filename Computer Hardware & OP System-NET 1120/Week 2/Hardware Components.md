## Purpose
This artifact demonstrates the differences in hardware components. This artifact demonstrates the differences in RAM (
 Random Access Memory) and the various types of RAM to include DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, DDR3, DDR4, AND DDR5. Ths artifact 
 also demonstrates the variosu types of storage devices to include flash drives, hard drives, and RAM. This artifact also
 demonstrates a working knowledge of the components of a motherboardand their respective location on the mothewrboard

## What I did
RAM or Random access memory, is the short term memory, for all intents and purposes, of a computer. A type of memory
that allows quick access to information needed during use, RAM is cvolatile, meaning it can be erased if the computer 
is shut down before said data is stored in its hard drive (i.e. long-term memory). There are a few variations of RAM: 
1) The most common is Dynamic RAM (DRAM) where capacitors are used to store data.
2) Static RAM is by far the fastest and most expensive which is why it is primarily used for caches on CPUs. This increases its processing and data accessing speeds needed for the CPU.
3) Synchronous Data RAM or SDRAM is RAM that has been synced with the system's clock. This, in turn, produces faster RAM speeds as it works in conjunction with, rather than against, the motherboard. This is now considered legacy.
4) To replace SDRAM, we have Double Data SDRAM, now called DDR. This is now the most widely used type of RAM in personal computers. Laptops use something similar that will be covered.
5) There are now three types of DDR used. In 2007, DDR3 came out as a 240-pin, 1.5V, speedy 800-2000MT/s RAM chip. DDR4 doubled the speed to 1600 MT/s and lowered the voltage to 1.2v. They reconfigured the pins to a new 288-pin configuration.
6) By 2021, DDR5 doubled even the DDR4 processing speeds up to 4800 MT/s while dropping the voltage again to 1.1V. They also again reconfigured to a new, different 288-pin configuration that isnt compatible with DDR4. The DDR5 is also capable of up to 64 GB additon per RAM module.
7) RAM used in PCs and laptops are also different. The RAM modules used in laptops are called SO-DIMM, a much smaller configuration (67mm) compared to the DIMM (133 mm) of a typical PC RAM module. The two are not compatible and cannot be interchanged due to the size differences.  

 Storage Devices
 There are many different types of storage devices based on the use of them within a single computer. Depending on the type of memory used and whether the memory is volatile or non-volatile (volatile means the data would be erased from said storage if power supply turned off) depends on its use and placement in a computer. 
 For example, the BIOS/UEFI chip on the motherboard is a non-volatile chip used to store boot data for the motherboard. Serial AT Attachment (SATA) connections run from the motherboard to the hard disk drive (HDD), solid state drive (SDD) or solid state hybrid drive (SSHD). Other types of volatile memory used besides the RAM modules would include SD cards or flash drives used to transfer data from cameras and smaller end devices. 

 
## Reflection
I havce learned the various types of RAM, how to install the RAM, how to install CPUs, motherboards, and thermal paste. I would like more hands-on experiences and plan on buiilding my own desktop soon. For now, you're never too old to learn.
