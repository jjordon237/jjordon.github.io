                                        Weekly Reflection — Week  01
                                        
“What do you hope to gain from this course, and how do you think it will connect to real-world IT support roles?”

Throughout my life, I have always used and liked computers. From learning Berenstain Bears Counting on my mom’s Apple 3 to my first time playing Space Cadet
Pinball on my dad’s Gateway with Windows 95, I felt at peace. This course has brought my love back to computers. I plan on gaining as much knowledge as I can 
to forge a new career path such as an IT support staff at a local school district where my knowledge of hardware, operating systems, cybersecurity, and 
networking would be invaluable to ensure the students’ education does not get interrupted. These classes provide hands-on, immediate knowledge and instruction 
to work in such areas.  For example, using the CIA Triad of cybersecurity, I would have to consistently use protocols and HIPAA law to protect students’
confidentiality, the integrity of the information to ensure its not tampered with such as grades, and all students and staff have availability to the data stored
within the school’s system.
