Hardware: An IT Support worker’s bread-and-butter: “The role of computer hardware and operating systems in IT support.”

“Effective IT support is part mechanic, part medic—solving problems in both the machines and the systems that power them.” — Adapted from industry 
wisdom (SAGE, 2025). As so many people begin to use computers and digital media daily, IT support is more needed than ever. Each fall, a new batch of smiling, 
Axe-smelling high school freshman receive their Chromebook to complete assignments on. Those IT supports are the unseen medics of every single corrupted file,
early-morning Starbucks run before class spill, and broken screen punched in anger. They must be proficient in hardware, but they must also be proficient in 
software and operating systems to troubleshoot issues.

As any good IT professional knows, hardware and operating systems are two sides to every coin. You cannot have one without the other in this digital age, and a 
good IT professional must be proficient in both areas. In terms of hardware, an IT support staff must recognize all parts of the computer or laptop, be able to 
diagnose hardware issues, upgrade hardware, and repair or replace parts as necessary. IT professionals must be able to fix and repair anything from cracked screens,
broken keyboards, to corrupted hard drives. 

The other side to the IT coin is the operating systems and software. A good IT staff must have decent working knowledge of operating systems. They need to be able to 
manage network systems as well as manage and troubleshoot errors within user mistakes, handle all the security issues such as updates and patches for each computer 
within the system, and set up and manage all hardware and set up any correlating interfaces and connect to the network. IT support is also responsible for permissions 
for authorized personnel. 

The IT support relies heavily on the CIA Triad of cybersecurity in terms of software and operating systems use as well. For example, in terms of confidentiality, good 
IT support must only allow the authorized users to see said data. At the public-school level, an IT staff must also follow HIPAA laws so authorized users on the system 
is crucial. For integrity, a good IT support must have good knowledge of cybersecurity to make sure that data, such as grades, are not tampered with in any way. And 
lastly, availability is so crucial to an IT support as the students and teachers must have reasonable access daily to their information whenever they log in. If issues
in terms of login happen, that IT support can troubleshoot those errors. 

They may look tired and stressed, chugging coffee like true medics, but IT support work cohesively with hardware and operating systems to bridge the gaps between 
hardware performance, ease of use for their respective coworkers, staff and students, and cybersecurity for the system.
