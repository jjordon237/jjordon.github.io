Lab 1: Hardware and OP Systems: Name That Hardware


•	 Identify major internal components (motherboard, CPU, RAM, storage, PSU, expansion cards).
•	Document safe handling procedures (ESD, power precautions).
•	Submit lab sheet or annotated diagram via Blackboard.

1.	Power supply unit (PSU) is used to convert AC power from the wall socket, convert it to DC power, and send the power to various hardware devices in the computer. 
2.	RAM-Random access memory used as short-term working memory for data and programs that are being accessed by the CPU. The most common in desktops are double data rate synchronous DRAM such as DDR2/DDR3/DDR4 RAM. 
3.	Motherboard, the main printed circuit board, is the central nervous system of the computer, with its ability to connect all essential components of the computer and facilitate communication between them such as the CPU, RAM modules, and any expansion cards used. 
4.	Central Processing Unit (CPU) is responsible for interpreting and executing commands as well as handling all instructions from end devices such as keyboards and mice, interpreting that data and instructions, and outputs the information in its own respective way such as your mouse moving your cursor. 
5.	Storage: Most desktops use either a Hard Disk Drive (HDD) with a magnetic disc that spins to store data or a Solid-State Drive (SSD) that stores information via electrical signals within the memory. They have various sizes and styles based on the size of the respective pieces of equipment. 
6.	Expansion cards as empty expansion slots as you see here can house extra cards such as Graphics Processing Units (GPU), Network interface cards for Wi-Fi capabilities, and sound cards. Other cards such as video capture cards, RAID controller cards, and TV tuner cards could also fit. 

The safe handling procedures when dealing with electrostatic discharge (ESD) are as follows: 
1)	When handling all pieces of internal hardware such as CPUs, RAM modules, or motherboards, you MUST ground yourself via an Anti-static wrist strap to be always worn. 
2)	The Anti-static wrist strap must have the metal connected with the wearer’s skin and the attached alligator clip either be connected to a grounding work mat or the edge of the case, being sure to attach to bare metal. 
3)	You must always remember to do this or risk the consequences of damaging the sensitive components such as CPUs and RAM modules. 


When opening any computer or piece of electronic equipment, certain precautions must be taken due to some pieces of equipment having capacitors that can hold onto mass quantities of power for long periods of time. IF you manage to touch those capacitors, a large discharge of electricity could damage or even kill you. Therefore, you MUST be mindful when working on any piece of equipment.
