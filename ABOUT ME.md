Hello, and welcome to James Jordon's Github. My name is James J, and Iâ€™m currently studying Cybersecurity and Network Systems at Hocking College.

I come from a Psychology background as I have my Bachelors in Arts from Ohio University. Coming from a former social work environment, I handle stress in difficult situations and can thrive in pressure. I also have a soft and quiet side. 
I enjoy working with hardware, troubleshooting system builds, and anything hands-on. Rewiring and fixing machines makes sense to me. I am also a family man with the best wife I could ever ask for and father of four to the best children I could imagine. 


At this time, I am focused on building my skills in network security and system protection through courses like CYBR-1110 (Cybersecurity), NET 1111 (Cisco I-Intro), and NET 1120 (Hardware & OP Systems). I plan on utilizing all of my certifications to provide outstanding, career-driven support to the right company. 


My goal is to enter the IT field as a support technician or cybersecurity analyst and keep learning as tech keeps evolving. With the speed at which hacking has intensified, 
Cybersecurity is more crucial than ever to companies large and small. My goal is to use my knowledge and training to provide outstanding service and support for your 
networking, hardware and operating system, and cybersecurity needs.
