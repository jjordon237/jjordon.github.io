This is a modified version of my home network. With a family of six, I have many devices that need the internet access. From my children's school Chromebooks
and cell phones, our personal laptops, PCs, and tablets are all neccesary tools in this digital age. This is a demonstration to show how complex and convoluted even home networks can become.
This shows how important it is to perform upkeep and maintenance on networks to make sure no unauthorized devices attach to your network.
