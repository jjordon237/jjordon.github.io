                                              Star versus Mesh Topology/Cable Modem versus Network Switch 

When building any network, it is imperative you decide how to set your network up. Medium to larger networks use two typical patterns called star topology or mmesh topology. 
Star topology is defined as having a centralized hub or switch end devices connect to such as computers and printers. Mesh tology is defined as an interconnected web of every single end device on the server.
The star topology is good for smaller businesses where one end device, such as computer going down, will not crash the system unless the central hub is attacked. If that occurs, the entire star topology of the 
network would fail. This is the key difference between a mesh topology network. In a mesh topology, if an end device connection fails, the data can move through other network connections. This allows the mesh topology network to be much safer, described as fault tolerance.
In the end, the key takeawayt is how much does a company want to spend on a network? Do they need a simple small-to-medium sized network where a star topology would be sufficient in a small office setting, such as a car dealership? Or do they need to have 
protocols to endure data entry and sharing is secure and quickly accessible via nearly any computer in the system? I have seen data-entry companies utilize mesh topology for their networks for this reason.
Lastly, in terms of scalibility, a mesh network adding new end devices can get very complex very quickly while star topology allows scalability very easily as the central hub or switch can add more as necessary. 

The key differences between a network switch and a cable modem are very stark as they both complete very important, but vastoy different functions. A cable modem is the access point for a network to connect to the internet through its internet service provider (ISP) via a coaxial cable line.  
A switch, on the other hand, is a device that connects various end devices in a Local Area Network (LAN) together so they can communicate to each other via ethernet cables. A switch does not provide access to the internet on its own as it allows the computers and printers of the LAN to communicate within the LAN itself.
This is very useful in an office setting where multiple end devices may need to speak to each other, such as file sharing and printing.
