                        Portfolio 1: Plugged In: How Networks Power Our Everyday Lives
                        
	“Data is not just information; it’s the thread that binds our identities to the hands that pull it.” ― Timsux Wales 
 
>From the minute you wake up and shut off the alarm blaring on your cellular phone to when you check your email, look in your Smart fridge, or drive your smart
car, you are using networks. They surround us like air. We can see it through internet access, but do we really know what the Internet (a true interconnected 
network of networks) really is? Or how deeply it affects our lives? Networking affects literally all aspects of our daily lives from cell phone use, online banking, 
telecommuting for work or school, and many others. 

>Living in this digital age, a cell phone is practically a necessity for even shopping at certain stores, such as using the Kroger app to use “digital deal” coupons 
 only accessible through their app. You will use Internet-of-things (IoT) to set up smart devices and connect them with a home network. From smart lights and appliances
 to smart thermostats and security devices such as Ring doorbell cameras all use the internet and networking. 

>Healthcare has also turned digital where all records are electronically updated in real-time and then uploaded for ease-of-use between various doctors’ offices, patients, 
and other health care professionals. This jump from analog and paper copies to near-instant digitally updated records has sped up patient care where every single second 
wasted on writing could cost a patient their life. So you see, every single aspect of daily life has been affected by networking both inside and outside of our careers,
families, and personal uses. Now think…what would the world be like without networks?
