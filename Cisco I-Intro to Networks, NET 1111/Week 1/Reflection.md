Weekly Reflection: Week 1

Growing up in the 1990s, I remember a time when every single new appliance, video game, 
 toy, or tablet needs the internet. Most people did not carry cell phones and just lived in 
 the moment.  I remember playing outside with friends which graduated to LAN parties, which again 
 graduated to online COD. Today, we telecommute anywhere through the internet and networking,
 even into video games.  I have taken for granted just how much networking we have used and 
 continue to use daily. 
 
 I had a rudimentary knowledge of hardware and operating systems as well as 
 cybersecurity, but Cisco networking has been a learning curve for me. I would like to learn more 
 about how to set up a sever, maintain a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO), medium network, and large 
 business network. I would like to know how to utilize a network switch and how to set up and maintain
 the network software. Packet Tracer has been invaluable to learning how to virtually set up networks, 
 but issues such as “Host name unresolved” and others, I would like to learn how to troubleshoot. 
 All in all, this class has been a completely new subject, very difficult but rewarding. 
 
 You are never too old to learn.
