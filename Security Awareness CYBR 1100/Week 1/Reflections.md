Weekly Reflection — Week  01	
•	Section 1: What I learned (6–8 sentences) Technology has become so ingrained in today’s society, you cannot go outside, order a meal, or even pay bills without some form of technology to help. With each and every additional personal computer, cell phone, tablet, even Smart Fridge can be hacked and needed cybersecurity to protect it. Every 39 seconds, an attempted or successful hack is completed. (Ciampi). Cybersecurity, in this society, is critical, if not the most important step in protecting your devices. However, drawbacks do occur. Cybersecurity is not as cut and dry such as buying McAfee and expecting it to be the end-all-catch-all for viruses, worms, trojans, and other nasty forms of malware. The main drawback is with over 1.5 billion forms of malware and ransomware, you cannot always protect against every single attack. This is where cybersecurity comes into play. The White Hat hackers are used by companies to specifically find and close exploitable holes, but there are far more Gray hat and Black hat attackers either looking to enrich themselves, or gain an edge and exploit a company. I have also learned about the CIA triad of cybersecurity: Confidentiality (the ability that only the approved individuals are allowed to see the data stored within the system); Integrity (The data stored in the system was not tampered with, either accidentally or maliciously); and Availability (the approved users of the system my have access to the data within the system whenever requested). 
•	Section 2: How I’ll apply it (1 paragraph) Having a comprehensive cybersecurity protocol can not only protect you from malware before it gains access to your system as well as minimizing the destruction and deletion of said malware post-attack. I will apply these lessons to having a multi-layered system of protocols on all my devices for added security features to include two-step verification and biometrics scanning. I will also monitor data breaches on several sites that publish said breaches. For example, a report on MSN indicated that up to 2.5 Billion users were reportedly affected by the newest data breach that occurred today, August 25, 2025. This breach was due to poor security at Salesforce leading to the data of many small and medium sized businesses to  lose user data to a well-known ShinyHunters ransomware group known as UNC6040 (ExtremeTech, 2025). 
•	Section 3: Muddiest point (3–4 sentences) The muddiest points I am having issues with are, if the case is how fast malware and ransomware can adapt, how do we truly fight it and use cybersecurity as a discipline to keep our information safe? I need hands-on programs that can prevent malware from entering my system as well as good programs for removing malware if entered already. For now, I need to understand the underlying theory for cybersecurity, the CIA triad. 
•	Section 4: Portfolio note (2–3 bullets)
o	CIA triad of cybersecurity: Confidentiality (the ability that only the approved individuals are allowed to see the data stored within the system); Integrity (The data stored in the system was not tampered with, either accidentally or maliciously); and Availability (the approved users of the system my have access to the data within the system whenever requested).  
o	Cybersecurity is defined as protecting any and all systems from digital attack. Types of threat actors include nation-state actors (spies), hactivists, script kiddies, cybercriminals, and insider threats (current or former employees). The most common types of threats include phishing, ransomware, malware, man-in-the-middle (MitM), and denial-of service  (DoS). Lastly, vulnerabilities are the weaknesses that are left to be exploited by hackers. Threats are potential danger posed to the system. And risk is the likelihood plus the impact of what if the hack succeeded. And by minimizing access, using multi-layered verification, and firewalls and antivirus software, your vulnerabilities can be mitigated before threats become attacks.  
•	AI Use Note (if used): SAGE AI was used to refresh my understanding of the CIA Triad and of the issues with data breaches such as the one that occurred today, August 25, 2025 (See reference).
