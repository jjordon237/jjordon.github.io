Purpose
This artifact demonstrates the introductory lessons I have learned from CYBR 1100 to include the extreme importance of cybersecurity, not just for your personal information, but for society as a whole.

What I did
Week 1, our class covered what is cybersecurity, the difficulties in maintaining cybersecurity due to the vast amounts of devices, operating systems, and various types of malware. We also learned the McCumber Cube and CIA Triad of cybersecurity: Confidentiality (a set of rules and protocols used to prevent sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands), Integrity (this ensures said protocols or information from the system cannot be modified either intentionally or accidentally), and Availability (the ability for only authorized users to be able to access the information stored in the system and maintaining unauthorized users from gaining access). We also learned the different types of hackers such as black hat, grey hat, and white hat hackers and their respective positions.

Reflection
Throughout the last five decades, an explosion in the amount of new Smart devices have hit store shelves to include cell phones and smart TVs to smart appliances, and each and every one are susceptible to cybersecurity threats. In fact, there are over 1.39 billion pieces of malware aching to get into your system. Cybersecurity, through the use of the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) can protect many of those devices from harm. Confidentiality, referring to the set of protocols that prevent sensitive data from being leaked to the wrong individuals, can prevent hackers from gaining your personal information. Integrity, referring to the assurance that the system information or its protocols cannot be intentionally or accidentally modified allows customers the knowledge their products will not be tampered with internally, and availability, referring to the ease of access of information for only authorized users, for example using two-step verification, ensures that only the authorized users of those devices are allowed access to that information. This information and knowledge of the CIA Triad and how cybersecurity was built has given me a good framework that I have begun building my cybersecurity career, keeping in mind each of the tenants of the CIA triad and how to keep the information in my personal, student, and business accounts more secure. The most interesting point I learned is how often an attempted hack occurs, once every 39 seconds, an absolute staggering number.
