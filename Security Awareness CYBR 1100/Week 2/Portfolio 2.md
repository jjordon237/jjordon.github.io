                                          **Case Project 2-1: Testing Password Strength**

How strong are your passwords? Various online tools can provide information on password strength, but not all feedback is the same. First, assign the numbers 1–3 to three passwords that are very similar (but not identical) to passwords you are currently using, and write down the number (not the password) on a piece of paper. Then, enter those passwords into these three online password testing services:
●	How Secure Is My Password (www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/)
●	Password Checker Online (http://password-checker.online-domain-tools.com/)
●	The Password Meter (www.passwordmeter.com/)
Next to each number, record the strength of that password as indicated by these three online tools. Then use each online password tester to modify the password by adding more random numbers or letters to increase its strength. How secure are your passwords? Would any of these tools encourage someone to create a stronger password? Which provided the best information? Create a one-paragraph summary of your findings.
Password Strength 	How Secure	Password Monster 	Password Tester
1	500 quadrillion years 	4 billion trillion years	Very strong/Centuries to crack
2	42 quintillion years	36 billion trillion years	Very strong/Centuries to crack
3	500 quadrillion years 	21 billion trillion years	Very strong/Centuries to crack

***Edit: Due to Password Checker Online and The Password Meter links being broken, I utilized Password Monster at (Password Strength Meter) and Password Tester at (Password Strength Tester | PasswordTester.org)
	According to the three sites used, the password chains I use to generate my passwords appear to be very secure as I follow the rules set forth from the book (1: No dictionary or phonetic words 2: No repeating characters/numbers 3: No personal information 4. Long passwords only. Password Monster gave reliable information of adding extra characters to increase my security. From now on, I plan on using a key of seven-by-three characters and numbers randomized for a total of 21 random XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX digits instead of the six-by-three  XXXXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXX. This added another layer of security to increase it to 355 billion trillion years. These tools would absolutely instruct the general public about how truly unsecure their passwords are and how much they need to increase simple rules in creating passwords to add security. How Secure and Password Monster gave the user more information on how to create a better password via hints after imputing their password and showing its hackability. 
## Purpose
This artifact demonstrates how I have understood 1) how to create strong passwords using randomized, nonrepeating sets of upper and lower case letters and numbers in a seven-by-three 21-character password, 2) realize how easily passwords can be cracked via hashing especially if personal information is used, and 3) why I use said attacks to break Brute force, password spraying, and any other password hacking attempt.

## What I did
•	I began by setting up three randomized, non-repeating fake passwords in a six-by-three password array in a similar way I created my personal password chains. My hypothesis is the passwords I use will be very secure. 
•	I then tested each password checker with the three passwords. Data was then written down and stored in the table. 
•	Results reported that each checker stated my passwords were incredibly secure and would take billions of years to hack. I then experimented with adding extra upper case randomized letters and numbers which increased my security tenfold. The strongest passwords contained seven-by-three arrays with randomized upper case and numbers.  
•	I then collated the information into the document showing that my hypothesis was confirmed through my data.  
 
## Reflection
I have learned that the rules I stand by have served me well and will continue to use my randomized letter/number chain to add a layer of security to my passwords. The results from the websites showed that the passwords are nearly unhackable, but instead of utilizing an 18-digit layer, I plan on using a 21-digit layer in an array of seven-by-three numbers and letters. This added another layer of security that bumped up security from 36 billion trillion years to 355 billion trillion years. I will now create an array of 20+ randomized seven number/digit codes and mix-and-match to create stronger passwords.
