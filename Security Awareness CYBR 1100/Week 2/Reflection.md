                                            Weekly Reflection — Week  02
•	Write 250–300 words describing a personal cyber risk you’ve encountered (such as phishing, unsafe password practices, or social networking oversharing).
•	Explain what made it risky and how you would handle it differently after this week’s lessons.

•	Section 1: What I learned (6–8 sentences): 
•	Three weeks ago, I was a substitute teacher preparing for another school year—teenagers, hormones, attitudes, and lesson plans. I didn’t expect how much my career would pivot after enrolling in this cybersecurity program, buying a new laptop, and starting college again.

•	Shortly after purchasing my laptop, my mother received a phishing email targeting a shared credit card. It claimed that a Geek Squad security subscription package had been purchased for $498.98 and included a fake invoice. The message read: Personal subscription plan 2 years, auto debit, $498.98. It will take 1-2 business day to reflect this transaction in your bank statement. You have only 24 hours to cancel your subscription and get your refund. For more info, kindly get in touch with our customer support at 1-803-745-4582.”

•	The email was riddled with grammar and spelling errors, and it used urgency to pressure the reader into calling the fake support number. This is a classic phishing tactic, using fear and limited time windows to manipulate people into reacting before thinking.

•	Thankfully, both my mother and I understand these scams and we follow a family protocol: any time someone wants to use our shared credit card, we notify each other beforehand. That habit helped us avoid becoming victims.

•	This real-life example reinforced this week’s lesson about phishing: attackers often exploit trust, urgency, and fear. Recognizing these red flags can make all the difference in staying safe online.


•	Section 2: How I’ll apply it (1 paragraph) 

I will apply this newfound knowledge of learning how to spot malware, phishing scams, and any other scams across
the internet and help people understand and avoid them. I will help people learn to use the password strength tester 
as well as phishing scam games to practice. I will also help my family understand how to set up Muli-factor authentication
as well as strong randomized passwords. 


•	Section 3: Muddiest point (3–4 sentences) The muddiest points I had problems with are since there are so
many various types of Malware we studied (spyware, adware, backdoors, ransomware, rootkits, scareware, viruses, 
trojans, and worms), how can we even protect ourselves from that onslaught, and if not, how do we remove them? 
These hands-on questions I need to study and learn. If there are MiTMo attacks, have they been successful against iPhone? 


•	Section 4: Portfolio note (2–3 bullets)
o	There are many types of malware, scams, and vulnerabilities that can affect your personal information. By watching for the signs such as watching for red flags in phishing emails (spelling and grammatical errors), you can stay vigilant. 
o	Keeping your passwords in a randomized array of upper/lower case letters and numbers, you can increase the effectiveness of your passwords tenfold which would drastically decrease efficacy of a brute force attack or hash-grab MitM attack. 
o	Always apply cybersecurity threat assessments even within your real-life such as watching for social engineering infiltrations, watching out for red flags, and remember, if it feels too good to be true, it is. 


•	AI Use Note (if used): SAGE AI was used to help rewrite some parts to help clear up confusion and user language error. 


•	Formatting: 11–12 pt, 1.15–1.5 spacing, clear headings.

•	Submit as: .docx or .pdf in the Week’s Reflection assignment.
